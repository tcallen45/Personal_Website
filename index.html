                    <p>I am currenty in my third year at UVA and I have spent my time exploring new opportunites. My classes have challanged me to learn more about the world around me, while developing much better organizational and time management skills. My tutoring experiences through Madison House at Albermarle High School and Venable Elementry School showed me the impact I can have in other student's learning and helped develop my technical communication skills. My time on UVA's Club Ultimate B team has given me an outlet for my energy and has given me a strong community. I am looking forward to leading my team this year as a captain. </p>
                    <p>UVA has deepened my desire to learn, given me opportunites to grow, and helped me become a better person.</p>

                    <p>As an intern, I was in a pod working with three other interns on developing an internal web application to assess team's agile maturity.
                       The tool created saves agile delivery leads and other managers hundreds of hours of manual work across the company. I went into this internship
                       with little knowledge of Angular, AWS, and Jenkins, however throughout the project I was able to quickly learn about these technologies in order
                       to contribute to the project. This internship was a great learning experience as I got to use many different technologies and work on a professional
                       team for the first time.

                    <p>I was tasked with prototyping an drilldown alluvial flow diagram to show the budget for the Virginia State Government. I utilized the Javascript library AnyChart to display the diagram and used JavaScript to carry out the drilldown and display of extra information. I was able to learn more about PostgreSQL, node.js, and Express throughout this project. To view this project <a href="https://sankey-ejs.herokuapp.com/">click here.</a></p>

                    <p>I was part of a research team that was looking at how humans trust autonomous driving systems in various situations. A typical trial would involve a participant sitting in a driving simulator and having the simulator "drive" different routes with obstacles including pedestrians, trucks, and bicyclists. As a research assistant I would take notes on how the participant reacted in the different situations and run the software to begin the trial and record data from the simulator. I gained a new understanding of some of the challanges we face as we continue to move towards having more autonomous vehicles on the road.</p>

                    <p>My time at Washington-Lee introduced me to many of the things I am still very involved in including, Computer Science, Ultimate Frisbee, and Tutoring. I took my first computer science class my junior year and I quickly grew to love what I was learning. I helped tutor middle school students in Algebra my junior year through a tutoring program hosted at my school, and the following year I became president, where I helped organize what we would do each tutoring session and interacted with their teachers to understand where each student was at in terms of their learning. </p>

                    <p>As a part of a five member team I developed a Django web application intended for UVA students to use for finding peer tutors in various subjects.

This causes the league table to update and show the current league standings. Along with this I utilized the reading and writing of files to allow the app to save information about the tables for when the app is closed. </p>

As part of my IB Computer Science class I was tasked to develop a program and write about the planning process, design choices, and challanges I faced. I decided to make a copy of the game Connect 4 and through this project I was able to learn more about 2D Arrays and reading and writing to files in order to save and load games. Throughout this project I faced many challanges and overcoming them was a rewarding experience that helped solidify my decision to study Computer Science at UVA.</p>
